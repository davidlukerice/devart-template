Finally decided to join in! I'm currently a Masters student and am doing research on genetic art. More specificially, I've begun to specialize in audio synthesis. And even more specific, evolving the topologies and parameters of synthesis engines, aka evolving a synthesizer. However, deciding whether or not a synthesizer is good or not (the genetic fitness) is not an easy task. To get around having to develop an algorthm that determines the 'goodness' of a synth engine, I've decided to make the process interactive.

IEC, interactive evolutionary commputation, is where human users determine the fitness of various evolved objects. However, this process is typically slow and results in user fatigue as they have to rate object after object. This where Collaborative Interactive Evolution (CIE) comes in. CIE leverages multiple users as they branch off each others objects to create more complex and interesting objects than would be typically allowed by a single user. An example of this is [Picbreeder](http://picbreeder.org/ "Picbreeder").

My Thesis is centered around taking CIE ideas and leveraging them to evolve synth engines. When I was about to start designing out and developing the needed platform for this, I happily discovered google's DevArt project and decided join in and develop the software as part of the competition!

Some basic designs for the website:

The front page will help users discover instruments that others have created.
