# Evolutionary Exploration

#### "... give priority to the inventive, [the] exploratory..." ~Desmond Morris, The Human Zoo

## What's worth developing?

Looking at the entire space of possible software, what parts of it are worth exploring, prototyping, and developing into polished applications? For one, if there's no benefit to the individual using the software or if no one actually uses it, the resources spent honing in on a particular point in the app space will have been nearly wasted (I say nearly since there's the chance that developing the app itself produced a benefit for the developers, increases their skill or positioning them in creating the next app).

Aligning with Morris, I rank the abilities to explore, discover and invent among the top strengths of humanity. The "Holy Grail" platform to develop as a software engineer, then, would not only inspire individuals to discover (see what works already exist) but also provide a guided means for both advance and novice users to explore (expand on those works) and create (bring about new works).

## Art Software Space

The artistic domain provides an excellent realm for technology, and software more specifically, to augment for exploring/discovering/creating. Artistic works can inspire individuals through a variety of senses and give glimpses into new and exciting possibilities. In the visual realm, works can not only be searched for and viewed online (explore/discover) but can also then be composited, edited, or referenced in the process of creating new works. Audio, which is the focus of GenSynth, can be similarly augmented.

## Evolutionary Approach

Similar to the scientific theories of organisms evolving based on crossing and mutating an abstract structure (dna) that grows into live organisms, pieces of art can be "grown" based on an underlying structure that evolves over time. Evolutionary techniques are ideal in situations, like art, where there is no specific solution or technique in determining that solution. There have been various attempts of encoding a value to the creativity or aesthetic of these grown structures [The Art of Artificial Evolution], and although some success has been seen in creating interesting pieces, the value of a work of art is better left to the subjective minds of its creator and viewers. A more user directed approach (as seen in IEC and CIE mentioned in a previous post) is required. The collaborative evolutionary approach utilized by GenSynth to evolve sounds and the instruments that produce them provides a platform to discover pre-existing works (instruments), explore new instruments through guided evolution, and create by publishing the explored instruments and the eventual ability to manually tweak them.

The evolution page itself will guide users in evolving their own instruments.
