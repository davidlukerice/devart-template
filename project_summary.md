# GenSynth


## Authors
- David Rice, https://github.com/davidlukerice

## Description
GenSynth is a collaborative web environment for evolving audio synthesizer instruments with genetic programming. The idea is to provide an intuitive way for users to evolve their own or branch of others' digital instruments and traverse the possible sound space.

## Link to Prototype
** _DISCLAIMER_: Turn down audio before testing, a lot of the generated sounds right now are pretty harsh. **
